Cast iron skillet on high, season meat once at room temp with olive oil, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper.  Cook on high with several whole cloves of garlic and fresh rosemary 4.5 minutes per side.  After the first flip, add butter and baste. Set 5 minutes.  

I had it with potatoes cooked in the same skillet but it'll also go well with rice or anything that essentially absorbs and compliments flavor.  Asparagus or spinach might work too. Definitely a red wine dish.
