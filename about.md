I'm a developer with a passion for open source software, web, mobile, and interpreted languages. Particularly interested in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java, Linux, and developing the best product with focused teams using lean methodologies and solid test cases.  I'm fascinated with distributed, fault-tolerant systems as well, such as CouchDB, Solr, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, Mesos, and Cassandra.  Also, MicroServices are awesome.

I also love cooking, video games, biking, running, weight lifting, and rowing (on an erg not crew yet).
